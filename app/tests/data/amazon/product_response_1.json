            "content": "The Inst360 camera has been fun to use. The camera\u2019s image stabilization impressed me most. I attached the camera to my mobility scooter and went for a \u201cwalk\u201d around the neighborhood. I was worried about the video recording as I saw the camera swaying atop the extended pole mount while I went over sidewalk joints. I was extremely pleased to see that the resulting video was smooth as butter. What can be overwhelming is the amount of accessories that can be purchased to mount and use the camera, but that\u2019s also a good thing since there\u2019s so many use applications. I would like to see a car headrest mount made so I can have the camera directly above the center of my mobility scooter. The camera feels very solid in-hand and well-built. The phone app works well. The Insta360 GPS watch-like accessory is not necessary but does offer solid GPS data to the camera and frees up your phone from having to do that job. The customizable GPS data overlays on the video are really cool to view speed and other stats while the video plays. I\u2019m still experimenting with Google Street View uploads and my suggestion is to set the appropriate time zone to match what time the GPS satellites overhead are using so there won\u2019t be time conflicts that may result in an upload error to Street View. Seeing your imagery on Google Street View is fun and it\u2019s great being able to contribute data of parks, trails, parking lots, and streets that may have no Street View data or no recent data. The Insta360 team are great in responding and assisting with issues and that is reassuring for such a big investment. Lastly, the battery life compared to the size of the camera is great. Read more",

About 2 weeks of taking random footage walking, cycling, and some tripod timelapse footage.You need a powerful computer to edit videos. Recommended RAM is 32GB. Sometimes video projects won't finalize properly, or at all. Transitions and edit can go missing or get messed up, and a few times the final video was cut short.None of this is the fault of the camera itself, though I'm sure the insta360 Studio software could use optimization, and it should have ALL the same features as the phone app!My phone won't even attempt to edit videos with the insta360 app. It tells me straight up it doesn't have the performance and won't even make an attempt to edit.This may have focused on more negatives than positives, but I stand by the 5 star rating. Everything works perfectly and as expected, there are a ton of features and the images are all high-quality. They perfected the X series cameras with this. Longer battery life and built-in/removable/replaceable lens protectors are great.

I attribute this to the 1/2\" sensor size instead of larger 1\" ... this kinda stinks :(- When creating my tour, I used the official selfie-stick to hold the camera (and app to trigger), but the small tripod screwed into the base still showed (would love for it to magically make that disappear too if possible).
