Nice pump , but don't make a full one unless you plan to put it over your neck aswell. It glides on and is absorbed really quickly. With a light moisturiser over the top, I feel like my skin is not oversaturated. In fact, I feel like my skin has had a drink without becoming overloaded and feels nicer and plumper afterwards. The only thing I don't like about this is the scent, which reminds me faintly of the famous eau de toilette 4711. But stronger, in fact, for my liking the scent is a bit too strong.With a nice sized bottle this will last for ages.As a P.S. I would just like to add that I have not long ago finished this in October. that's 6 months worth in the bottle. Amazing! Read more",

It applies a treat and has a pleasant, understated fragrance making it ideal for everyday use. The lotion makes your skin feel immediately revitalised and freshened and is supplied by a pump dispenser which means you can easily regulate how much you use, and with this serum a little does go a long way. The whole packaging has an air of clinical efficiency, which probably sums up Murad products nicely. An expensive product that needs a sterling resolve to invest in, but if you do so I don't think you'll be disappointed. Read more",

I'm not convinced that its improved my wrinkles and lines but it certainly seems to look more radiant in the morning, having only used this serum for a couple of weeks its hard to tell.
