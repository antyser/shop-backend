## CRZ YOGA Butterluxe Racerback High Neck Longline Sports Bra Review

CRZ YOGA has carved a niche for itself as a purveyor of affordable activewear that often draws comparisons to higher-end brands like Lululemon. The Butterluxe Racerback High Neck Longline Sports Bra is yet another offering designed to deliver comfort, style, and support without breaking the bank. Here’s a breakdown of its key features, pros, cons, and overall value.

**Key Features:**

*   **Butterluxe Fabric:** Made with a blend of 81% Polyamide and 19% Lycra, the Butterluxe fabric is known for its buttery-soft texture and four-way stretch providing a comfortable, second-skin feel.
*   **Racerback Design:** The racerback design offers enhanced support and freedom of movement, distributing weight across the back and preventing strap slippage.
*   **High Neckline:** The high neckline provides enhanced coverage and a modest look, making it suitable for wearing as a standalone top or layering.
*   **Longline Silhouette:** The longline design extends further down the torso, offering additional support and a flattering silhouette that can be styled as a crop top.
*   **Removable Pads:** Includes removable pads for customized shaping and support.
*   **Versatility:** Suitable for low to medium-impact activities like yoga, Pilates, barre, and everyday wear.

**Pros:**

*   **Exceptional Comfort:** The Butterluxe fabric lives up to its name, offering a luxuriously soft and comfortable feel against the skin. Many users find it comfortable enough for all-day wear.
*   **Stylish Design:** The racerback, high neck, and longline silhouette are all on-trend, making this bra a fashionable choice for both workouts and casual wear.
*   **Good Support for Low to Medium Impact Activities:** The racerback distributes weight well and the longline band provides additional security, making it suitable for activities like yoga.
*   **Affordable Price:** One of the biggest strengths of this bra is its price point. It offers a similar look and feel to Lululemon’s Align Tank and Energy Bra.
*   **Versatile Coverage:** The high neck provides adequate coverage if you prefer a more modest look.
*   **Accessibility:** CRZ YOGA is easily purchased online through retailers like Amazon.

**Cons:**

*   **Limited High-Impact Support:** May not provide enough support for high-impact activities like running or HIIT, especially for larger cup sizes.
*   **Potential for Slippage:** Some users have reported that the bra can slide down during workouts due to lower compression, requiring adjustments.
*   **Durability Concerns:** While many find the Butterluxe fabric pill-resistant, long-term durability may not match higher-end brands.
*   **Sizing Issues:** Sizing inconsistencies have been reported by some users, so it's important to check the size chart and read reviews carefully.
*   **Ethical Concerns:** There may be ethical concerns associated with the CRZ YOGA brand due to the company being a Chinese brand. This can be countered by CRZ YOGA's claim that they comply to international standards.

**Conclusion:**

The CRZ YOGA Butterluxe Racerback High Neck Longline Sports Bra is a solid choice for those seeking a comfortable, stylish, and affordable sports bra for low to medium-impact activities. Its buttery-soft fabric, trendy design, and accessible price point make it a compelling alternative to more expensive brands like Lululemon. However, it may not be the best option for high-impact workouts or those who require maximum support. Potential buyers should carefully consider their size and activity level and keep in mind the need to follow proper care instructions to ensure longevity. Although there may be ethical concerns associated with the CRZ YOGA brand, CRZ YOGA states that they responsibly and ethically manufacture all of their products.
