### Conclusion

Millie Moon diapers present an appealing option for parents seeking a soft, absorbent diaper at a competitive price.

However, the numerous recent reports of rashes and skin irritation, potentially linked to a formula change, are a cause for concern.

**Recommendation:**

Due to the conflicting feedback, it's wise to exercise caution when considering Millie Moon diapers. New users should closely monitor their baby's skin for any signs of irritation, especially when using size 3 diapers. If irritation occurs, discontinue use and consider alternative brands. Parents may also want to contact Millie Moon directly to inquire about the recent formula change and its potential impact on skin sensitivity. While Millie Moon diapers offer a compelling value proposition, the risk of adverse skin reactions cannot be ignored based on the current user feedback.
