### Conclusion

The Samsonite Freeform 21-Inch Hardside Carry-On offers a compelling combination of lightweight design, spaciousness, and value, making it a popular choice for travelers. Its double spinner wheels provide excellent maneuverability, and the TSA lock adds a layer of security. However, potential buyers should be aware of the durability concerns, particularly regarding the handle and zippers, and the scratch-prone exterior.

While the polypropylene shell is more susceptible to scratches and may not be as impact-resistant as polycarbonate, it offers a good balance for most travel needs. Although technically exceeding the carry-on size restrictions for some airlines, user experiences suggest it often fits in overhead bins.

Consider your priorities when making a decision. If durability is paramount, explore polycarbonate options like the Samsonite Proxis, albeit at a higher price point. If you seek a lightweight, stylish, and functional carry-on at a reasonable price, the Samsonite Freeform 21-Inch Hardside Carry-On is a solid choice. Just be sure to handle it with care and consider using luggage covers to protect the exterior.
