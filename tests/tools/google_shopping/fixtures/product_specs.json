    "description": "Apple-designed H2 chip, the force behind AirPods Pro, pushes advanced audio performance even further. From smarter noise cancellation to superior three-dimensional sound and battery life, it improves on the best features of AirPods Pro in a big way. Low distortion, custom-built driver and amplifier delivers crisp, clear high notes and deep, rich bass in stunning definition. Every sound is more vivid than ever. Adaptive Audio dynamically blends Transparency mode and Active Noise Cancellation to deliver the best listening experience for you in any environment. Up to 2x more Active Noise Cancellation than the previous generation AirPods Pro, so you’ll hear dramatically less noise during your commute and when you need to focus. Transparency mode lets outside sound in, so you can hear what's going on around you. Conversation Awareness lowers media volume and enhances voices of people in front of you, all while reducing background noise to make it easier for you to engage with people nearby when wearing AirPods Pro. Personalized Volume automatically fine-tunes the best media experience for you in the moment. Personalized Spatial Audio surrounds you in sound tuned just for you. It works with dynamic head tracking to immerse you deeper in music and movies. Four pairs of silicone tips are included to fit a wider range of ears, with an extra-small size. The tips create an acoustic seal to help keep out noise and secure AirPods Pro in place. Touch control lets you swipe the stem to adjust volume. Press the stem once to answer, mute, or unmute yourself on calls, press it twice to end a call, or hold it to switch between listening modes."
